# redux-thunk-flow
A working example on how to use Redux with redux-thunk and 100% flow coverage

I have been struggling for a very long time now to get a fully working flowtype project using react, redux and redux-thunk. This project demonstrates in a very basic way how to do this. The important part is in the changed definition of Dispatch in the flow-typed definition of redux.

Now you can cross check the types between your connected component and the redux store.
